							<p>
								Sidebar navs are great for when you need an additional form of
								navigation in one of your webpages.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can even combine a sidebar with Bootstrap's scrollspy components.
							</p>
							<p>
								Scrollspy will scroll you to anchor links within the same page.

								An Integrated Development Environment for Python. IDLE is a basic
								editor and interpreter environment which ships with the standard
								distribution of Python.
							</p>
							<h3>Yeah I totally copied this from the Python docs...</h3>
							<p>
								However, some extension modules, either standard or third-party,
								are designed so as to release the GIL when doing
								computationally-intensive tasks such as compression or hashing.
								Also, the GIL is always released when doing I/O.
							</p>
							<p>
								Past efforts to create a “free-threaded” interpreter (one which
								locks shared data at a much finer granularity) have not been
								successful because performance suffered in the common
								single-processor case. It is believed that overcoming this
								performance issue would make the implementation much more complicated
								and therefore costlier to maintain.
							</p>
							<p>
								The implicit conversion of an instance of one type to another
								during an operation which involves two arguments of the same
								type. For example, <code>int(3.15)</code> converts the
								floating point number to the integer <code>3</code>, but in
								<code>3&plus;4.5</code>, each argument is of a different type
								(one int, one float), and both must be converted to the same
								type before they can be added or it will raise a
								<code>TypeError</code>. Without coercion, all arguments of
								even compatible types would have to be normalized to the same
								value by the programmer, e.g., <code>float(3)+4.5</code>
								rather than just <code>3+4.5</code>.
							</p>
							<h3>Another subheading</h3>
							<p>
								An extension of the familiar real number system in which all
								numbers are expressed as a sum of a real part and an imaginary
								part. Imaginary numbers are real multiples of the imaginary
								unit (the square root of <code>-1</code>), often written
								<code>i</code> in mathematics or <code>j</code> in engineering.
								Python has built-in support for complex numbers, which are
								written with this latter notation; the imaginary part is written
								with a <code>j</code> suffix, e.g., <code>3+1j</code>. To get
								access to complex equivalents of the math module, use
								<code>cmath</code>. Use of complex numbers is a fairly advanced
								mathematical feature. If you’re not aware of a need for them,
								it’s almost certain you can safely ignore them.
